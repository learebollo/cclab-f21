      You have completed the Image-ine Experience!
    </h3>
    <p>
      As humans, it is extremely important for us to maintain an understanding of our emotions. And I believe visual art and music are some of the most powerful tools to practice doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite forms of art expression is photography and I wanted to share with you a few photographs I have taken. I have memories tied to each one and they bring about really deep emotions for me, so the goal of this project is to make you feel the same using generative and interactive js components.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you were able to feel something and get in touch with your emotions today.
    </p>

      Thank you
