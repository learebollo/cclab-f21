      All my past lives
    </p>
    <p>
      They've got nothing on me
    </p>
    <p>
      Golden eagle, you're the one and only flying high
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the cities in the sky
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I'll take you way back
    </p>
    <p>
      Countless centuries
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you remember?
    </p>
    <p>
      That you were meant to be my Queen of Hearts
    </p>
    <p>
      Meant to be my love
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Through all of my lives
    </p>
    <p>
      I never thought I'd wait so long for you
    </p>
    <p>
      The timing is right
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars are aligned
