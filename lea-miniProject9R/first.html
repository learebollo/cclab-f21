      Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
    </p>
    <p>
      Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
    </p>
    <p>
      I've got the strangest feeling
    </p>
    <p>
      This isn't our first time around
    </p>
    <p>
      Past lives couldn't ever come between us
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time the dreamers finally wake up
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't wake me I'm not dreaming
